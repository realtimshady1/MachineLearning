# Machine Learning
This is a repository for all my WIP Machine Learning scripts, tools, and any other machine learning project. The projects are ordered by complexity as well as tags for what each project entails. I try my best to make sure everything is as original as possible, otherwise give credit to any borrowed inspiration so that anything here is free for use. 
## Projects
The following listed projects are completed machine learning projects in this repository, categorised by their subjective difficulty.
